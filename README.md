# Dynamics NAV Automator ![Project License Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen) ![Shield](https://img.shields.io/badge/WIP-!-critical)

A simple Auto Hot Key script made to automate basic tasks in Microsoft's Dynamics NAV. 

## Usage

You will need to install [Auto Hot Key](https://www.autohotkey.com/). Once you have this installed you can just copy the script file from this repo (or clone the entire thing). Then double click on the script to run it. Take a look at the script code to see which hot key is for each script.

Note: The click positions may need to be adjusted depending on your screen size (I would recommend running all windows in full screen). If you do need to change the click positions you can find the correct coordinates with the AHK Spy tool. More information about the tool can be found [here](https://amourspirit.github.io/AutoHotkey-Snippit/WindowSpy.html).
