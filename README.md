## Usage

You will first need to install [Auto Hot Key](https://www.autohotkey.com/). Once you have this installed you can just copy the script file from this repo (or clone the entire thing). Once you have the file simply double click on the 'Dynamics-NAV-Script.ahk' file to run it. 

Take a moment to look at the script code to see which hot key is for each script. In general scripts are invoked with `crtl` plus a numeric key. For example, `ctrl + 1` will start the first script in the file. 

<pre>
<b>Should the script start to go awry you can use the `crtl + esc` hot key to kill the script entirely.</b>
If you do this the script will need to be re-initiated by double clicking on the '.ahk' file again. 
</pre>

> **Note:** The click positions may need to be adjusted depending on your screen size (I would recommend running all windows in full screen). If you do need to change the click positions you can find the correct coordinates with the AHK Spy tool. More information about the tool can be found [here](https://amourspirit.github.io/AutoHotkey-Snippit/WindowSpy.html).
